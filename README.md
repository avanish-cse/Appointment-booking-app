# Appointment Booking Web App

A simple web app for booking appointments, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is my learning playground to practice DOM manipulation, form validation, and interactive UI components.

## Features

- Add new appointment calls via a form
- Input validation for:
  - Image URL
  - Full Name
  - Home Town
  - Purpose
- Select one category per appointment (Emergency, Important, Urgent, No Rush)
- View appointment details in styled note cards
- Buttons for Call or Message (UI only)
- Toggle between form and note view

## How It Works

1. Click the **Add Note** button to open the form.
2. Fill in the details and select a category.
3. Submit the form:
   - Form will validate your inputs.
   - If everything is correct, the note is added (UI updates to show notes).
4. Click **Close** to go back to notes view.

> Note: The project is still in progress. Currently, adding a note only updates the UI; data storage and editing features are planned next.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)

## Screenshots

*(You can add screenshots of your app here later)*

## Learning Goals

- Practice JavaScript form validation
- Learn event handling and DOM manipulation
- Build interactive UI components from scratch

## Future Plans

- Save notes to localStorage so they persist on page reload
- Add edit and delete functionality for each note
- Improve UI responsiveness and styling
- Possibly add search/filter feature for notes

This is a beginner project, so don’t expect everything to work perfectly yet! I’m using this app to experiment and learn more about front-end development.
